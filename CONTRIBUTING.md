# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first make sure you follow the following git and coding conventions. 

## Git Conventions and Pull Request Process 

1. Each new feature should be developed on it's own feature branch. The branch naming should be feature/XX_FeatureName,
 where XX is the Trello ticket number (e.g. 41_awesome_feature).
2. Each commit should start by the branch name between brackets (e.g. [41_awesome_feature] Commit description). 
If you followed the 'Getting started' steps, this should be automatic, thanks to the seventh step.
3. When the feature is done, your branch should be rebased on top of the develop branch
4. Once the feature branch is up to date, you should open a pull request. (Don't forget to add a reviewer, 
so that someone gets notified).
5. At least one person of the team should review the PR and the tests should pass for the PR to be accepted.

## Coding Conventions

For now nothing special. Just follow the Ruby On Rails conventions as well as the [SGMAP conventions](https://github.com/sgmap/beta.gouv.fr/wiki/Developpement).
